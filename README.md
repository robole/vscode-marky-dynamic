## Features

Marky Dynamic supports open and closed ATX-style headings (the ones that use hashes).

### (1) Manage a Table of Contents (TOC)

The command `Marky Dynamic: Add/Update the Table of Contents (TOC)` will add a table of contents (TOC) at the cursor position in the active markdown document. If the TOC exists already, it will be updated.

![Add TOC](img/screenshots/add-toc.gif)

- The setting `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table of Contents: Level Range` determines which headings are included.
- The setting `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Slugify Style` determines how the ID for the links are generated. It excludes the text from bookmark links.
- Indentation is based on your User Settings (`Editor: Insert Spaces`, `Editor: Tab Size`, and `Editor: Detect Indentation` )
- The CodeLens entry on the top of the TOC indicates if it is "up-to-date" with the document. You can click this entry to update the TOC.

  	![Update TOC](img/screenshots/update-toc.gif)

- You can choose to have the TOC update automatically whenever the document is saved by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Update On Save` option in the Settings.
- You can choose to add a label to the top of the TOC by editing the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table Of Contents: Label` option in the Settings.

The command `Marky Dynamic: Remove the Table of Contents (TOC)` will remove the TOC. You do not need to select the TOC for this to happen.

### (2) Manage Heading Bookmarks

It is helpful to readers to have a link in headings for bookmarking different sections of a document for navigation and sharing. You probably have seen this done automatically by GitHub to `readme.md` files, like in the image below.

<img src="img/screenshots/heading-link.jpg" style="border:1px black solid;" alt="heading link" /><br>

The command `Marky Dynamic: Add/Update Heading Bookmarks` will add bookmark links to the headings in the active markdown document.

![add bookmark link to headings](img/screenshots/add-heading-link.gif)

It does the following:

- The `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Table of Contents: Level Range` determines which headings are included.
- By default, it will add a link with the text '**‚àû**', this is the infinity character, which looks like a link! In the Settings, you can customise this text (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Text`), or specify an image (`Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Bookmarks: Link Image Path`). If you provide text and an image, the image will come first.
- The setting `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Slugify Style` determines how the ID for the links are generated. It excludes the text from bookmark links.
- You can choose to have the bookmarks update automatically whenever the document is saved by enabling the `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Update On Save` option in the Settings.

The command `Marky Dynamic: Remove Heading Bookmarks` will remove the bookmark links from all headings.

### (3) Manage Section Numbering

The command `Marky Dynamic: Add/Update Section Numbering` will add section numbers to the headings of the active markdown document.

It does the following:

- The `Marky Markdown ‚Ä∫ Section Numbering: Level Range` determines which headings are included.

The command `Marky Dynamic: Remove Section Numbering` will remove the section numbers from all headings.
